## ECE 594T Lab 2

These are two modified examples from the chai3d Library. In 04-shapes we did some basic experiments on a haptic device, in 09-magnets we implemented the worlds worst version of air hockey. If you want to actually run these examples you'll need to replace the official example with the same name in the chai3d source code, and then compile the whole project.
